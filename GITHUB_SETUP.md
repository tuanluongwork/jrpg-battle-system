# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository with these settings:
   - Repository name: `jrpg-battle-system`
   - Description: "A turn-based JRPG battle system built with Cocos Creator 3.x and TypeScript"
   - Public repository (to showcase your skills)
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

If you get an authentication error, you may need to:
1. Create a Personal Access Token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Use the token as your password when prompted

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

To host a live demo:
1. Build your Cocos Creator project for Web
2. Push the build to a `gh-pages` branch
3. Go to Settings â†’ Pages in your repository
4. Select source: Deploy from a branch
5. Select branch: gh-pages

## Step 4: Enhance Your Repository

- cocos-creator
- typescript
- game-development
